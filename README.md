#R Programming 

1. On naval dataset plot a Kernel density of Compressor Decay State Coefficient, and then
answer the following question
What kind of distribution does Compressor Decay State Coefficient have?

2. Draw a scatterplot matrix on the naval dataset and watching the diagram name any two
features which are linearly related to most of the other features.

3. Apply Min-Max scaling on the naval dataset.

4. From the naval dataset find out mean and median of both the outputs.

5. Load the Titanic dataset (inbuilt to R), then find out 
how many male child survived?
How many first class passengers were there?
